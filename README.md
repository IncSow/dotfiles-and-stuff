# dotfiles-and-stuff
A bunch of my dotfiles, settings and themes!

## What can you find there ?

1. My bashrc. Nothing too fancy, yet!
2. My i3wm profile, which includes my theme, the terminal I use (CRT) and a few tweaks here and there.
3. A script that switches my i3wm theme between the purple one and the Halloween one.
4. My CRT themes !
5. Two scripts, one to back-up the previously mentionned files, and one to put them back into the correct place.
